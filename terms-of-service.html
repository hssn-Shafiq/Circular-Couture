Our receipt of full payment from you will discharge your debt to the relevant Seller in respect of your purchase.

You have a legal obligation to take reasonable care of the product(s) while in your possession. If you fail to comply with this obligation, the relevant Seller may have a right to deduct the cost of any deterioration (due, for example, to your having used the product(s)), up to the price of the product(s), from the refund to which you are otherwise entitled.</span></p>
